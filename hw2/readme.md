## Instructions
**This folder contains the dataset of homework1, the python script I wrote and the sample result of the script.**
**In the hw2/ folder, it contains:**

* **data/**: This is a folder for the datasets I used in this project.
 + **waterTemperature.csv**: it contains temperature data of different times.
 + **energy.csv**: It's a csv file for the energy value of different days.
 + **readme.md**: It's a description file for the datasets.

* **script/**:  It contains the python script I wrote for this project.
 + **6791_hw2_update.py**
 + **6791_hw2.ipynb** It has the same content as the .py file but it was generated by the Jupyter notebook. We can run this in Jupyter directly.

* **results/**: It contains a sample .csv result which was produced by using the water temperature dataset and the energy data. To get it, we can use the command at the last 2 lines of .py file:

```python
filenames = {'1':["waterTemperature.csv","energy.csv","merged.csv"]}
main(**filenames)
```
The output contains all of the information of waterTemperature.csv and add an additional column of energy values for a particular time which is matched with the temperature data logged just before that time. What's more, I changed the unit of energy value from 'wh/1000' to 'wh' by making energy values divided by 1000.

### Execution instructions:
In this project, I used the \**kwargs when defining the function, so that the user can run the script on multiple pairs of files, such as from multiple months, and always append the merged data onto the same output file, which could then contain data from a whole year.
Therefore, we'd better to define the argument as a dictionary, such as:

``` python
dic = {'Jan':['waterTemperature1.csv','energy1.csv','output.csv'],'Feb':['waterTemperature2.csv','energy2.csv','output.csv'], 'Mar': ['waterTemperature3.csv','energy3.csv','output.csv']}

#call the main function
main(**dic)
```
Another point I want to mention is:
if the output filename has already existed in the current path, there is an option to append to the existed file or overwrite it. If you want to append to the existed file(such as we want to get an output file which contains multiple months' data), then choose 'a' in the interaction blank after the question **''The filename exists, do you want to append on it or overwrite it? (append(a)/overwrite(o))''**. But if you want to overwrite it, just choose 'o'.

If the output filename is missing in one of the lists in the dictionary, we have the code:
```python
elif x ==2:
  first = filenames[keys][0] #first argument is the water temeprature file, for example.
  second = filenames[keys][1]#second argument is the energy file, for example.
  third = sys.stdout #third is missing. so we set it as stdout.
```
this means if the length of a list under one of the keys in the dictionary is 2 (for example: "Apr":['waterTemperature4.csv','energy4.csv']), the result will be returned to the STDOUT stream. When using Jupyter notebook, you can see the results just below the command block.

### Quick view of the results (show first 62 lines of merged.csv)
Here, I take the waterTemperature.csv and energy.csv for example to run the code and generate a .csv file.
